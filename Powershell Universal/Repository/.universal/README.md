# Home Assistant + Powershell Universal

[Powershell Universal](https://www.ironmansoftware.com/powershell-universal) is a product by [IronMan Software](https://www.ironmansoftware.com/) which provides API endpoints via custom powershell scripts, as well as providing a way to create user interfaces in powershell scripts among many other features. There is a free version that provides a limited feature set but still gives you most of the core features. You can host the product multiple ways, I personally have mine hosted on a raspberry pi in a docker container.

## Why use this over Home assistant's built in dashboards?
Just for fun really. For learning powershell universal's dashboard feature home assistant can be an easy to setup data source if the PSU host is on the same network as the home assistant host.
